Hello ladies and germs. This website was created by me. Nick Campos.
If you have a problem with me then I suggest you stick around. Why?
Well because there is so much more than just Nick Campos on Nick's
Website.


Lay back. Crack open a cold one.
Pet the pet closest to you.
Breathe.


This is a safe space.

Now if you are reading this, that can either mean you are a close friend
...or you randomly stumbled onto this repository from github. Either way
god help you.

Anyways...

I am working on this website to help improve my skills in HTML5, CSS,
and Javascript (still working on those last two). That being said,
everthing you see on this website was completely handwritten
by me <sub>:)</sub>
<sup>what? like you can't tell?</sup>

                          on nick's website? that may have been a
                          <b>slight</b> fabrication...

So in conclusion, have lots of fun exploring my website. If there are
any problems just lmk @nnickcamp on IG. Just don't complain.
<sub>Looking at you karen</sub>

I am hoping to learn CSS and Javascript soon so you guys can vandalize
my <em>beautiful</em> website with your weird pictures or something.
