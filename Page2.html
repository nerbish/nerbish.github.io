Well... yeah.

But unfortunately there is not much one bored teen could do on his own.
And I am not sure if I feel like sharing such a dumb project.<sub>yikes</sub>

I am not 100% sure what I want this website to be.
And you know, that's okay.

I think some of the best ideas come from uncertainty.

                                                                  <sub><i>nick what are you going on about</i></sub>

Now now young grasshopper. I know what i'm doing.

      <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        My Bonnie lies over the sea.

        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
